# Unidentified-Flying-Objects
--- 
- Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.
## Overview of the Project
Building an HTML page that pulls information from a javascript file and filtering the page. Using filters allows us to examine the different sightings that occurred throughout the U.S.-- based on the different areas or what type of shape of the sighting.

## HTML Page and our results

Seen in the snippet below we have 5 different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country & shape. After filtering inputs within the search bars, our HTML page presents the given sightings for a particular search. Multiple filters are able to be entered simultaneously.

## Summary
Clean filtering and sifting through the different sightings in the UFO data set. One thing we could optimize - our search bar is attempting to validate the sightings that happened which can be better described in the data. Adding the number of people that were at the sighting would be a helpful element to validating the claims. Increasing the data elements, and shear variety would allow us greater validity to our claims ... or at least add to their substantiallity. 

Two recommendations for improving this website: 

1) Additional data on the sightings, including how many people were at the site 
2) Filtering to find the duration of a given sighting, as well as optimizing the site to integrate social media tags (#) - thus live updating on new sightings
